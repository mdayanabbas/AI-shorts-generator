# AI-shorts-generator
This project automates video creation using a Python/Flask backend. It orchestrates Gemini for scriptwriting, ElevenLabs for narration, and Pexels for visuals. FFmpeg then compiles these elements into a finished video, demonstrating a full generative AI workflow from a single prompt to a final product.

## ‚ú® About The Project

In the age of short-form content, the ability to produce engaging videos quickly is a massive advantage. This project was built to explore the complete automation of the video creation process, handling everything from the initial creative idea to the final rendered MP4.

This is not just a call to a single API; it's a full-stack application that manages a complex generative workflow, demonstrating how to build robust, practical AI-powered systems.

## üöÄ Key Features

-   **üìù AI-Powered Scriptwriting**: Leverages Google's Gemini Pro to generate unique scripts and titles for various niches (e.g., Horror Stories, Motivational Speeches, Historical Facts).
-   **üó£Ô∏è Lifelike Narration**: Integrates with ElevenLabs' API to produce high-quality, human-sounding text-to-speech audio for the script.
-   **üéûÔ∏è Automated Visuals**: Intelligently queries the Pexels API to find and download relevant, high-quality stock footage that matches keywords extracted by the AI.
-   **üé¨ Intelligent Compilation**: Uses FFmpeg to automatically:
    -   Combine and edit video clips to match the narration length.
    -   Overlay the narration track.
    -   Mix in appropriate background music based on the video's mood.
    -   Standardize the output to 720p HD resolution.
-   **üåê Simple Web Interface**: Built with Flask to provide an easy-to-use interface for starting the generation process.

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Python & Flask** | Core backend language and web framework.   |
| **Google Gemini API** | For AI scriptwriting and keyword extraction. |
| **ElevenLabs API** | For generating high-quality voiceovers.      |
| **Pexels API** | For sourcing royalty-free stock videos.    |
| **FFmpeg** | The powerhouse for all video/audio processing and compilation. |
| **HTML/CSS/JS** | For the simple frontend interface.         |

### System Architecture

The application follows a sequential pipeline to generate the video:

```
[User Selects Niche] -> [Flask Backend]
      |
      v
[1. Gemini API] -> Generates {Script, Title, Keywords}
      |
      v
[2. ElevenLabs API] -> Generates narration.mp3 from Script
      |
      v
[3. Pexels API] -> Downloads video clips based on Keywords
      |
      v
[4. FFmpeg] -> Compiles clips + audio + music -> final_video.mp4
      |
      v
[Returns Video to User]
```

## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
* **Python 3.8+**
* **FFmpeg**: You must have FFmpeg installed on your system and accessible from the command line. You can download it from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
* **API Keys**:
    * Google Gemini API
    * ElevenLabs API
    * Pexels API

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git)
    cd YOUR_REPO
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
    ```sh
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
