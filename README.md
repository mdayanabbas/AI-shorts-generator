# AI-shorts-generator
This project automates video creation using a Python/Flask backend. It orchestrates Gemini for scriptwriting, ElevenLabs for narration, and Pexels for visuals. FFmpeg then compiles these elements into a finished video, demonstrating a full generative AI workflow from a single prompt to a final product.
